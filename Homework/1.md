# Homework 1 - HPC

1. In following program example we were assuming that each call to `Compute_next_value` requires
   roughly the same amount of work in each loop iteration. For your reference:

   ```cpp
   auto my_sum = 0;
   auto my_first_i = /* ... */;
   auto my_last_i = /* ... */;

   for (auto my_i = my_first_i; my_i < my_last_i; my_i++) {
      auto my_x = Compute_next_value(/* ... */);
      my_sum += my_x;
   }
   ```

   Let's now consider instead that a call when $ i = k $ requires $ k + 1 $ units of time as the call
   when $ i = 0 $. Example: if the first call requires 1 millisecond, the second requires 2ms, the
   third requires 3ms, and so on.

   How much time each core will spend in the loop calling the function `Compute_next_value` if
   $ n = 15 $ and $ p = 3 $? Where $n$ is the number of elements in the loop and $p$ in the number of
   available cores.

   **Answer:**

   I'm not entirely sure where $ k $ comes from to be honest, there's a few ways to interpret it. I
   will ask professor Petruzza what he thinks.

   | Core | Time (ms) |
   | :--: | :-------: |
   |  0   |           |
   |  1   |           |
   |  2   |           |
